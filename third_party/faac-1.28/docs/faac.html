<br><br>

<a name="opts">
<b>Options:</b><br>
<menu>
<li>
<kbd>-a X</kbd>
	Set average bitrate to approximately X kbps per channel
	(i.e. using -a 64 averages at 128 kbps/stereo).
<li>
<kbd>-c &lt;bandwidth&gt;</kbd>
	Set the bandwidth in Hz (default value depends on sample rate)
<li>
<kbd>-q &lt;quality&gt;</kbd>
	Set quantizer quality (default: 100, averages at approx. 128 kbps VBR for
	a normal stereo input file at 16 bit and 44.1 kHz sample rate).
<li>
<kbd>--tns</kbd>
	Enable TNS coding.
<li>
<kbd>--notns</kbd>
	Disable TNS coding.
<li>
<kbd>-n</kbd>
	Disable mid/side coding.
<li>
<kbd>-m X</kbd>
	AAC MPEG version, X can be 2 or 4 (default: MPEG-2, so for
	the sake of interoperability with non-standard compliant players
	like QuickTime 6 you should set it to "4").
<li>
<kbd>-o X</kbd>
	AAC object type, X can be LC, MAIN or LTP (default: LC, for the
	same reason as with the MPEG version don't use Main or LTP).
<li>
<kbd>-r</kbd>
	RAW AAC output file (i.e. without ADTS headers).
<li>
<kbd>-P</kbd>
	Raw PCM input mode.
<li>
<kbd>-R</kbd>
	Raw PCM input sample rate in Hz (default: 44100 Hz).
<li>
<kbd>-B</kbd>
	Raw PCM input bit depth (default: 16 bits, also possible 8 bits).
<li>
<kbd>-C</kbd>
	Raw PCM input channels (default: 2).
</menu>

<kbd>- &lt;stdin&gt;</kbd>
  If you simply use a hyphen/minus sign instead of an input
  file name, FAAC can encode directly from stdin, thus enabling piping
  within other applications like foobar2000 or mp4live.
<br><br>

<a name="notes">
<strong>Note:</strong> VBR output bitrate depends on -q
<em><strong>AND</strong></em> -c, so you should only vary the default
setting -q 100 -c 16000 if you know what you're doing and/or want to
experiment with other cutoff frequencies at a given quality setting.
<br><br>
The ABR setting with -a is an approximate average bitrate that does not use 
a bit reservoir, i.e -a 64 and -q 100 at 44.1 kHz will result in exactly 
the same output file.<br>
<br>
The following list should give some orientation for useful -q and -c settings,
based on FAAC v1.17. The resulting VBR bitrates are referring to an average
sounding stereo file with 16bit, 44.1 kHz, i.e. 
ct_reference.wav in this case. Multiplexing these AAC files to MP4 with e.g. mp4creator will result in a ~3 kbps lower bitrate because of the stripped ADTS headers:<br>
<br>
-q 130 -c 22000 -m 4 (~218 kbps)<br>
-q 120 -c 20000 -m 4 (~194 kbps)<br>
-q 110 -c 18000 -m 4 (~158 kbps)<br>
-q 100 -c 16000 -m 4 (~129 kbps)<br>
-q 90 -c 14000 -m 4 (~103 kbps)<br>
-q 80 -c 12000 -m 4 (~79 kbps)<br>
-q 70 -c 10000 -m 4 (~62 kbps)<br>
<br>
The added -m 4 switch does not change the bitrate or sound of course,
but is recommended for most AAC/MP4 players that use an updated FAAD2-based
plugin from this year (Winamp 2.x, foobar2000 etc.) or can't decode
MPEG-2 AAC LC files like QuickTime 6. Philips Expanium users should not use
this switch, because their CD portable does not know MPEG-4 AAC files.
